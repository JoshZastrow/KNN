This Repository contains several machine learning implementations that I learned about while working through Stanfords course on  Convolutional Neural Network for Visual Recognition.

Concepts covered:
- K Nearest Neighbor
- Linear Regression
- Support Vector Machine
- Hinge Loss
- Softmax
- Cross Entropy Loss
- L2 Regularization
- Batch Processing (Batch Gradient Descent)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Neural Networks
- Backpropogation
- Batch Normalization
- Dropout
- hyperparameter optimization techniques

Algorithms can be found in cs231n/classifiers

Details about this assignment can be found [on the course webpage](https://cs231n.github.io/assignment1/).
