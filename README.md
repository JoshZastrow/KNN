This Repository contains several machine learning implementations that I learned about while working through Stanfords course on  Convolutional Neural Network for Visual Recognition.

Concepts covered:
- K Nearest Neighbor
- Linear Regression
- [Support Vector Machine](https://github.com/JoshZastrow/Machine-Learning-Image-Classifiers/blob/master/svm.ipynb)
- [Hinge Loss](https://github.com/JoshZastrow/Machine-Learning-Image-Classifiers/blob/master/cs231n/classifiers/multiclass_svm.py)
- [Neural Networks](https://github.com/JoshZastrow/Machine-Learning-Image-Classifiers/blob/master/two_layer_net.ipynb)
- [Backpropogation](https://github.com/JoshZastrow/Machine-Learning-Image-Classifiers/blob/master/cs231n/classifiers/neural_net.py)
- [Cross Entropy Loss](https://github.com/JoshZastrow/Machine-Learning-Image-Classifiers/blob/master/softmax.ipynb)
- [Softmax Linear Classifier](https://github.com/JoshZastrow/Machine-Learning-Image-Classifiers/blob/master/softmax.ipynb)

See Conv-Nets Repository for examples on below:
- L2 Regularization
- Batch Processing (Batch Gradient Descent)
- Stochastic Gradient Descent
- Batch Normalization
- Dropout
- hyperparameter optimization techniques
